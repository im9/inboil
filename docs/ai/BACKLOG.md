# Technical Backlog

Known improvements that don't require design decisions (no ADR needed).
Items are not prioritized — pick based on what you're already touching.

## Ideas

Someday/maybe items — no commitment, just interesting directions.

- [ ] **Particle oscillator** — Granular cloud from wavetable. MONO or low grain count (8–16) to stay within CPU budget (ref: ADR 113)
- [ ] **Wavetable editor** — Draw waveforms on Canvas → 2048 samples → `_bandLimit` → inject into table cache (ref: ADR 113)
- [ ] **User wavetable import** — Load .wav single-cycle files as custom shapes (ref: ADR 113)
- [ ] **Per-oscillator filter** — Filter before osc combine, not just after (ref: ADR 113)
- [ ] **Audio-rate FM mod source** — oscB as mod matrix source for audio-rate modulation (ref: ADR 113)
- [ ] **More filter types** — Phaser, vocal resonator, analog-modeled ladder (ref: ADR 113)
- [ ] **Slide/glide parameter** — Explicit per-step slide flag and glide time param, instead of relying solely on auto-legato
